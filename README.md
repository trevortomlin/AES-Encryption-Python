# AES-Encryption-Python
AES algorithm implemented in python.

## Description
This program encrypts and decrypts text using AES128 ECB. The key can be manually input or can be generated by the built in Python CSPRNG.

## Installation
`
git clone https://github.com/trevortomlin/AES-Encryption-Python.git
`

## Usage
```python
from AES_Encryption import AES_Encryption

text = "Two One Nine Two"

ae = AES_Encryption(userKey="Thats my Kung Fu")

ct = ae.encrypt(text)
#encrypt returns a list of all encrypted blocks so this prints only the first one.
print("Text Encrypted: ", AES_Encryption.stateToString(ct[0]))

#decrypt() returns a list of all decrypted blocks so this prints only the first one.
t = ae.decrypt(ct)
print("Text Decrypted: ", AES_Encryption.stateToString(t[0]))

```

## Technologies Used
Python, Numpy, Secrets

## Improvements

- Implement more modes of operations such as CBC or CTR. [ECB is insecure.](https://blog.filippo.io/the-ecb-penguin/)
- Calculate SBOX instead of using a lut.
- Update variable and function names to be PEP8 compliant.
